            Answer of the Questions:-

        <h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    Bringing cheetahs back to Kuno National Park is very important because it helps restore India’s wildlife. Cheetahs had disappeared from India long ago, and their return shows hope for saving and protecting animals that were lost.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    At first, Arjun only loves listening to the sounds of nature. Later, he becomes more involved and curious. He watches the cheetahs, learns about them, and starts caring deeply for wildlife.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The cheetahs might find it hard to get used to the new land, weather, and food. They also have to learn to live safely among other animals and humans in Kuno.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The story shows that protecting animals and nature is very important. If people care for wildlife, even lost species like cheetahs can return and live freely again.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The local people help by supporting the project, protecting the cheetahs, and spreading awareness about saving animals and nature.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    When Arjun learns about Aasha, the cheetah whose name means “hope,” he feels inspired. He understands that every animal is special and that humans must protect them.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Cheetahs help keep nature balanced. They control the number of smaller animals and help the grasslands stay healthy. Their return makes the ecosystem stronger.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The story mixes old and new ideas — it talks about India’s lost cheetahs (tradition) and also about the modern scientific project to bring them back (modernity)
