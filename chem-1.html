                    <p>Soil is levelled with the help of a wooden plank pulled by the bullocks. The plank is kept pressed to the ground. Levelling can also be done by a heavy wooden plank attached to a tractor.</p>
                    <p>By levelling, the feild gets coverde with soften soil. This reduceloss of moisture from the soil.</p>

                    It is an efficient system of watering plants. It supplies water to the plants,. It supplies water to the plants with the help of pipes . The supply of water can be regulated and supplied only when the plant need it. The advantages of drip irrigaion are as follow:-

                    Some kind of plants which is grown in large areas are called crops. Two examples of rabi crops are potato and mustard and two example of kharif crops are soya beans and paddy.

                <li>
                    The removal of crops when the produce is ready is called harvesting. In some feilds, harvesting is done manually by using a sickle, a couved metal blade with a sharp edge fixed in a wooden handle. After harvesting, the crop is allowed to dry completely. Cre should be taken that seeds ofdo not contaminate the produce. The weeds should be seperated while harvesting.

                    Pest are animals that damage crops they can be controlled by spraying pesticideson them. We should aviod using chemical pesticide and insecticides because they are harmful chemical which contaminate water, soil, air and affect our health.
