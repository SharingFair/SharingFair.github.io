                    The passage reveals that Vikram Sarabhai was deeply interested in space and stars from his
                    childhood.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The author compares other children chasing butterflies to young Vikram chasing star patterns in the
                    sky. This highlights Vikram's strong passion for space.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Ahmedabad holds significance as it was Sarabhai’s birthplace and where his interest in science and
                    space first developed.

                <li>
                    Bhabha’s primary scientific interest was atomic energy and tiny parts of matter, while Sarabhai was
                    interested in space and its applications.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Their interests complemented each other because they worked together to advance India's scientific
                    progress, despite focusing on different fields.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The passage suggests that collaboration between scientists with different interests can be
                    beneficial and lead to major scientific achievements.

                <li>
                    The Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik into space in 1961 prompted Sarabhai to propose a space program
                    for India.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The meeting was significant because it led to the establishment of India’s own space program with
                    the support of Prime Minister Nehru.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The meeting shaped the future of India’s scientific endeavours by laying the foundation for the
                    country's space research and programs like ISRO.

                    Nehru recognised that space research could be practically used to improve communication, education,
                    and the lives of people in distant areas.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Nehru’s support was crucial, as it provided the encouragement, political backing, and resources
                    necessary for the success of India’s space program.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The passage shows that atomic energy and space research were closely linked in India’s early
                    scientific development, with cooperation between different scientific departments.

                    Initially, Bhabha did not focus much on space research. However, after seeing Sarabhai’s knowledge,
                    hard work, and passion, he changed his mind and supported space research.
                </li><br>

                    Sarabhai’s deep knowledge, dedication, vision for space science, and hard work impressed Bhabha.

                    Establishing INCOSPAR was important because it marked the formal beginning of India’s space program.
                    It laid the foundation for later developments like ISRO.

                    Vikram Sarabhai was born in Ahmedabad in a rich and educated family. He loved science from
                    childhood. He studied in India and later went to Cambridge. His family and good education helped him
                    become a great scientist.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Sarabhai and Bhabha had different interests—Sarabhai liked space, and Bhabha liked atomic energy.
                    But they worked together and supported each other. Their teamwork helped India grow in both space
                    and atomic science.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Nehru wanted to use science for the country’s progress. He liked Sarabhai’s idea that space science
                    could help common people. Nehru gave full support to Sarabhai to start India’s space program.

                <li>
                    India’s space program started with INCOSPAR in 1962. In 1963, the first rocket was launched. In
                    1969, ISRO was formed. Later, India launched many satellites and even sent missions to the Moon and
                    Mars.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Sarabhai had many problems like lack of money, facilities, and trained people. He solved these by
                    training young scientists, getting government support, and working with other countries.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Bhabha worked on atomic energy. Sarabhai worked on space science. Their different work helped India
                    grow in both fields—nuclear and space.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Sarabhai’s work started India’s space program. Today, ISRO is world-famous. His idea that space can
                    help people is still true. His work made modern India stronger in science.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Sarabhai said space research can help India by improving education, communication, weather reports,
                    and helping farmers. He told the government that space science is useful for the people.
