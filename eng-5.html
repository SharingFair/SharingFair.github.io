                    The Chenab Bridge is not just a bridge in the story. It is a symbol of connection between different
                    regions and cultures. It helped the friends physically cross into Kashmir, but it also changed their
                    thinking. It connected their hearts and minds with the people of Kashmir, making them realize how
                    close we all are as Indians.

                    At first, the friends thought Kashmir would be very different. They had many doubts and fears. But
                    during the journey, they saw beautiful places, met friendly people, and felt welcomed. They learned
                    that the people of Kashmir are just like them, and their perspective became more positive and open.

                    tradition, which helped break the barrier and build friendship.

                    Cultural exchange programs are very important. They allow students to meet others from different
                    parts of India, learn about their lives, and break false beliefs. These experiences build strong
                    friendships and help create a sense of unity. Such programs are powerful tools for national
                    integration because they teach respect, love, and cooperation among people from diverse backgrounds.
