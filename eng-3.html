                    Ahimsa means non-violence, and Aparigraha means non-attachment. In daily life, Ahimsa can be applied
                    by being kind to others, avoiding harm to animals, and using peaceful means to resolve conflicts.
                    Aparigraha can be followed by avoiding greed, living simply, and not becoming overly attached to
                    material possessions.
