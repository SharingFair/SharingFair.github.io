                    <li>
                        The poem shows rain as gentle and refreshing, helping all parts of nature.
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                Trees become lively and dance when they get rain.

                                Wilted flowers bloom again, and the Earth soaks up the rainwater.
                            </li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Even animals and birds respond to rain by finding shelter and later enjoying the Sun.

                        <ul class="arl">
                            <li>
                                Thus, the rain is portrayed as a friend who brings life, freshness, and energy to the
                                whole of nature.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        Rain refreshes the earth, revives plants, and fills rivers and ponds. It brings greenery,
                        coolness in the air, and life to animals, birds, and humans.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The poet uses imagery of shining raindrops, refreshed leaves, and blooming flowers. Words like
                        “sparkling gem” and the sound of raindrops create a lively picture in the reader’s mind.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Plants stretch, bloom, and look fresh after rain, while animals and birds feel joyful and
                        active. Both are revived, but plants show it by growth, while animals show it by movement and
                        sound.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The rain is shown as a friend of nature, helping plants, animals, and humans equally. It
                        supports life, removes heat and dryness, and connects all living beings.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The poem shows how rain renews life—dry soil becomes fertile, plants grow fresh, and the whole
                        environment is purified and transformed.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The mood is joyful, refreshing, and hopeful. The poet achieves this by using bright imagery,
                        describing the beauty of raindrops, and showing how nature celebrates rainfall.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The poem uses a regular rhyme scheme of ABAB and short stanzas. This rhythm mimics the
                        pitter-patter of rain and makes the poem musical and pleasing to read.
